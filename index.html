    <h2>Geo. Predicates Working Group</h2>
    <section id="abstract">
      <p>The Samvera Geospatial Predicates Working Group was chartered during June 2017 in order to determine a set of best practices and recommendations regarding the encoding of geospatial repository metadata as linked data. Samvera repositories aim to publish content descriptive metadata as linked data using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and those participating in this working group sought out to determine precisely which RDF ontologies would be best suited for linking descriptions for geospatial repository resources.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p><i>This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current releases and the latest revision of these recommendations can be found on <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Geo+Predicates+Working+Group">the Samvera Community Wiki</a>.</i></p>
      <p>This document was published by the Samvera Geo. Predicates Working Group as a community recommendation for RDF usage in Samvera repositories.</p>
      <p>All interested parties are invited to provide implementation and bug reports and other comments through the Working Group's GitHub repository. These will generally be considered in the development of future releases for this document.</p>

      <h2>Namespaces and Document Conventions</h2>
      <p>The names of RDF entities -- classes, predicates, individuals -- are URIs. These are usually expressed using a compact notation where the name is written <code>prefix:localname</code>, and where the <code>prefix</code> identifies a <i>namespace URI</i>. The namespace identified by the prefix is prepended to the <code>localname</code> to obtain the full URI.</p>
      <p>The following namespaces are used in this document:</p>
      <table>
